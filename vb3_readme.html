<div class="vbarea"><h2>Installing a new vBulletin 3</h2>
<p>First, unzip the vBulletin zip file you downloaded from the <a href="http://members.vBulletin.com/">members'
area</a> to your hard disk and then open the <span class="directory">'upload/includes/'</span> folder.
In this you will find <b>config.php.new</b>. You should rename this to <b>config.php</b> and
then open it in a text editor.</p>
<p>The config.php file is commented throughout, so you should be able to work
  out what values to enter for the variables yourself. When you have finished,
  save the file and then upload the entire contents of the <span class="directory">'upload/'</span> folder to
  your web server.</p>
<p>When this is done, point your browser at http://<font
color="red">www.example.com/forums/</font><b>install/install.php</b> (where <font
color="red">www.example.com/forums/</font> is the URL of your vBulletin) and proceed
  to click the <span class="click">Next
Step</span> buttons until the script asks to fill in some addresses and names
for your board.</p>
<p>After you have done this, the installer will ask you for some details to set you up as the administrator of the new vBulletin. A few more clicks and the script will be finished.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to the Admin Control Panel, you must delete the <span class="directory">'install/install.php'</span>  and
  <span class="directory">'install/upgrade1.php'</span> files from your webserver. You may then enter the control
  panel and start working on your new vBulletin!</p>
<p>The entire installation process should take no more than five minutes.</p>
<p>For a complete description of how to install vBulletin 3, see the <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/install">installation section</a> of the <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html">vBulletin 3 Manual</a>.</p>
<p>The values for the config.php file are described in detail <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/editconfig">here</a>. </p>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="vbarea"><h2>Upgrading from a previous version of vBulletin 3 </h2>
<p>Close your board via the Admin Control Panel.</p>
<p>Upload all files from the <span class="directory">'upload/'</span> folder
  in the zip, with the exception of <span class="directory">'install/install.php'</span>.
  Then open the <span class="directory">'upload/includes/'</span> folder. In
  this you will find <b>config.php.new</b>. You should rename this to <b>config.php</b> and
  then open it in a text editor.</p>
<p>Open your browser and point the URL to http://<font
color="red">www.example.com/forum/</font><b>install/upgrade.php</b> (where <font
color="red">www.example.com/forums/</font> is the URL of your vBulletin). You should now be automatically forwarded to the appropriate upgrade script and step.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions on the screen. Make sure you click <span class="click">next
    step</span> or <span class="click">proceed</span> until
  you are redirected to your Admin Control Panel. Here, you can reopen your
    board.</p>
<p>For a complete description of how to upgrade from a previous version of vBulletin 3 to the latest version, see the <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/upgrade">upgrade section</a> of the <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html">vBulletin 3 Manual</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that the format for config.php in vBulletin 3.5.x is different from previous versions of vBulletin, and you will need to manually update your config file to the new format. Instructions are <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com/docs/html/editconfig">here</a>. </p>

<div class="vbarea"><h2>Upgrading from vBulletin 2 to vBulletin 3</h2>

<p>The vBulletin 2 to vBulletin 3 upgrade script will upgrade your vBulletin 2 installation to
vBulletin 3.
<b>You will not lose any data</b>. Your vB2 styles will not be usable in vB3, but they will not
be deleted,
they will be kept in the database for your reference.</p>

<p><b>To upgrade, to vBulletin 3 your existing installation must be running at least vBulletin
2.2.9 or
higher.</b></p>

<p>If you want to upgrade your forums to vBulletin 3, you should first close
  your board via the vBulletin 2 Admin Control Panel, and then <b>make a complete
  back-up your database</b> using the
following
command from the system command line:</p>

<pre>mysqldump --opt -Q -u<font color="blue">username</font> -p <font
color="red">databasename</font> &gt; <font
color="red">databasename</font>.sql</pre>

<p>(Where username is your MySQL <font color="blue" face="monospace">username</font> and <font
color="red"
face="monospace">databasename</font> is the name of your database)</p>


<p>When your database backup is complete you should back up your existing vBulletin 2 PHP files
and images,
just in case you want to revert back to vBulletin 2 for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Before you proceed, you should run the <a
href="http://www.vbulletin.com/forum/showthread.php?threadid=73163">Database Conflict Detection
Script</a> to
make sure that the upgrade script will not fail due to any differences from the default vBulletin
2
installation in your database. If any conflicts are detected, you should resolve them before
proceeding with
the upgrade.</p>

<p>Next, unzip the vBulletin zip file you downloaded from the <a href="http://members.vBulletin.com/">members'
    area</a> to your hard disk and then open the <span class="directory">'upload/includes/'</span> folder.
    In this you will find <b>config.php.new</b>. You should rename this to <b>config.php</b> and
then open it in a text editor.</p>

<p>The config.php file is commented throughout, so you should be able to work
  out what values to  enter for
the variables yourself. When you have finished, save the file back into the <span class="directory">'upload/includes/'</span>  folder as
config.php.</p>

<p>Next, you should delete all vBulletin 2 files, including PHP, CSS and style
  files, along with  any images.
You should then upload the contents of the <span class="directory">'upload/'</span> folder to your server.</p>

<p>When the upload is complete, point your browser at http://<font
color="red">www.example.com/forum/</font><b>install/upgrade.php</b> where <font
color="red">www.example.com/forum/</font> is the URL of your vBulletin files.</p>

<p>Please note that we have found that due to the large number of pages that the upgrade script
loads, and
the speed at which it loads them, certain browser plug-ins can cause the browser to crash out for
various
reasons. The <a href="http://toolbar.google.com/">Google Toolbar</a> is one such plug-in, and we
have seen
browsers crashing due to the amount of browsing statistics being sent back to Google. If you have
plug-ins of
this kind installed, <b>turn them off</b> while running the upgrade script.</p>

<p>Running upgrade.php will automatically load the correct upgrade script and
  present you with a  message,
which you should read carefully. When you have finished reading, click the <span class="click">Next
  Step</span> button at  the bottom
of the page to start the upgrade process. When each page has completed its processing,
  it will  either give
you a <span class="click">Next Step</span> button to click, or automatically load the next page, depending
  on the type of  job the page
in question is doing.</p>

<p>Some steps will take quite a while to run, especially on large boards with large numbers of
posts/threads.
Please be patient and allow the script to complete.</p>

<p>If your browser crashes during the upgrade, or if you are on dial-up and your connection is
dropped (etc.)
then to restart the upgrade script simply point your browser at install/upgrade.php again and it
will work
out where you got to in the process and restart the process at the appropriate step.</p>

<p>For the most part, you do not need to do anything except click the 'Next Step' buttons to keep
the upgrade
script running. However, there are a few steps where the script will require your input to
continue. One of
these is the step where the script asks you to tell it which of your usergroups you use for
'Banned' users.
It is important to select these carefully in order to make the enhanced vBulletin 3 banning
system work.
Additionally, towards the end of the upgrade, as the cookie and user format is converted from vB2
format to
vB3 format, you maybe be required to log-in again a few times. This is the expected behavior.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> There are several upgrade scripts that need to be run. You do not need to
determine which
you need to run; they will be determined automatically. Simply click "next step" or "proceed"
until you
are redirected to your admin control panel.</p>

<p>When the scripts are complete, it will tell you to delete some files, and then redirect you to
the Admin
Control Panel. You should log in to this and proceed to the <i>Import and Maintenance</i> section
of the
control panel, where you should run the <i>Rebuild Search Index</i> and <i>Rebuild Statistics</i>
controls.
Both of these functions will take a quite a long time to run on larger boards.</p>
